MatplotlibDeprecationWarning: Adding an axes using the same arguments 
as a previous axes currently reuses the earlier instance.  In a future version, 
a new instance will always be created and returned.  Meanwhile, this warning 
can be suppressed, and the future behavior ensured, by passing a unique label 
to each axes instance.
